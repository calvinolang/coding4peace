# Summary
This project defines a course, coderdojo-like, for young Ukrainian refugees. It describes the content of the course, the hardware and software requisites as well as the logistics ones. Finally it summarizes the content of the lessons.
# Description of the course
Coding4Peace is a 4 lessons coderdojo course about coding mobile apps. 
CoderDojo is a global volunteer-led community of free programming workshops for young people between 7 and 17. https://coderdojo.com/.
Coding4Peace teaches how to develop mobile apps for Android/iOS using MIT App Inventor.
MIT App Inventor (https://appinventor.mit.edu/) is a web application integrated development environment originally provided by Google, and now maintained by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 
The target of this course are young Ukrainian refugees moving to the Zuid-Holland region of the Netherlands. Anyway participants from the Netherlands and other countries, including Russia, are welcome: one, non secondary, goal of the course is to facilitate the integration of the newcomers as well as to create a respectful and peaceful environment.
# Structure of the course
Each installment of the course is divided into 4 lessons aimed to bring the student from an elementary ability to develop apps to an intermediate one.  
Each lesson is described in the following paragraphs. Ideally a single instance of a course is made by a group of up to 8 students with 2, 3 or 4 instructors. The book supporting the course is free and is available at:
http://www.appinventor.org/book2
# Logistics/IT requirements
- The course will be held in an accessible place like a Library, a Buurtcentrum, a School or a similar place.
- In that place it has to be available a free WIFI connection as well sockets to plug 
- Students must register themselves to the http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/ site before taking the course
- Students will bring their laptops/tablets as well as their smartphones
- Students have to install the MIT App Inventor companion app before taking the course 
- The course will be delivered in Saturday mornings, 10:00-12:00 (tentative)
# Lessons
## Lesson 1: Elementary apps
The first lesson will introduce the student to the development of apps through App Inventor. The first app the students will develop is “HelloPurr,” a picture of a cat that meows when you touch it and purrs when you shake the device on which it’s being viewed. For the students that quickly build it a second app will be proposed for development, PaintPot, a paintbrush-like app to implement a graphical editor.
## Lesson 2: Pong and other games
The second lesson will focus on gaming. We will start recreating the classic Pong video game. Other games: LadyBug, MoleMash.
## Lesson 3: Language translation and other refugee oriented apps
The third lesson will focus on apps that can be useful for student life. First an app able to translate the voice of the student and then output of the translated audio, then a map-oriented app.
## Lesson 4: Artificial Intelligence
The last lesson is about creating artificial intelligence powered apps, like image recognition.
